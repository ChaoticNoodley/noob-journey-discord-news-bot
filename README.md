# Discord News Bot

**A Curious Beginner’s Journey Building a Discord News Bot**

This project is a simple Discord bot made with Python that automatically fetches and posts news about Windows and Linux systems into a Discord server.  
It was created mainly for learning purposes and just for fun.

I'm still a beginner in programming, so this project represents my experiments, mistakes, and learning process.
